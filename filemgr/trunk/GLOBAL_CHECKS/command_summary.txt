# Merrick upload file check
# We send files to Merrick bank each workday, and sometimes extra files make it into the upload folders (on purpose or by design).  
# This quick script checks the contents of the upload folders before the upload time and then after the upload time to catch any 
# files that may have unintentionally been left behind.
