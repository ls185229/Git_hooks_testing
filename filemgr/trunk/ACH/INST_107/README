get_ach_file.sh looks for MAS files in "/clearing/apps/mas/pdir/ositeroot/data/ach" directory
For 107 institution id with cycle "52", below are the file created out in the current directory

File name masks:
    ACH File - "$inst_id_ACH_2_$bank_$file_type_$txntype_$cdate.ach.gpg"
    Dump File - "$inst_id\_ACH_2\_$bank\_$file_type\_$txn_type.achfax.txt"
    Fax File - "$inst_id\_ACH_2\_$bank\_$file_type\_$txn_type.dump.txt"
        where $inst_id - eg : 101, 107 105 121 etc
        $bank - eg : WELLSFARGO,
        $file_type - 52, 62, 72
        $txn_type - CR, DB
        $cdate - date and time, file was created

CR and DB ACH files are generated and encrypted out of ACH file generated from the MAS system.
achfax & dump files are sent to "reports-clearing@jetpay.com"

====ach_auto.sh =====
ACH files will be uploaded to the bank using "ach_auto.sh" script
if the upload succeeds, then the corresponding ach & fax will be moved to the
    ARCHIVE directory.
if the upload fails, same ach file will be tried again after 10 seconds, if upload
    fails again, then the error details will be mailed to "clearing@jetpay.com"
