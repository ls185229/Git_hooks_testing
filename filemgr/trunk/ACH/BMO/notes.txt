1) After conversion to wells fargo, there is no credit/debit split up
   so while converting to python  We can use the bmo code and enhance it
   to support "FIRST PREMIER" ACH.

2) Try to use map file in masadmin to have alll the configurations stuff.

3) Combine the Canadian & US under one script. canadian ACH doesnt have clr_dump

4) Modify fax form to have total along with credit & debit.

5) If possible modify to look the count & amount similar BMO acknowledgment file.

6) Python library for NACHA file specifications.

Possible features for an ach / eft process:

    split debit and credit lines into two files

    generate an eft file from the ach file

    block the ach file with lines of all 9s to a modulus of 10

    balance the ach file (e.g., inst 121) with
        one additional batch using our settlement account with
            total debit for all credits and
            total credit for all debits.

    encrypt the resulting file(s)

    upload has test location (use while tesing)

    upload has no test location (use test stub routine while testing)

    balancing credit or debit entry in last batch (1st Premier)
